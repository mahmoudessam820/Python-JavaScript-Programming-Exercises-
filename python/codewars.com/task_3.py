    Create Phone Number

    Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), 
    That returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

    Example:

    create_phone_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) 
    # => returns "(123) 456-7890"

    Note:

    The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.
    Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!
