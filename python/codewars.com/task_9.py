'''
    Convert string to camel case

    - Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore 
    - Delimited words into camel casing.
    - The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original 
    - word was capitalized 
    (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case).

    Examples:

    "the-stealth-warrior" gets converted to "theStealthWarrior"
    "The_Stealth_Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"
