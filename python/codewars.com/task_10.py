    Simple Encryption #1 - Alternating Split ðŸ’¥

    - Implement a pseudo-encryption algorithm which given a string S and an integer N
    - Concatenates all the odd-indexed characters of S with all 
    - The even-indexed characters of S.
    - This process should be repeated N times.

    Examples:

    encrypt("012345", 1)  =>  "135024" 
    encrypt("012345", 2)  =>  "135024"  ->  "304152"
    encrypt("012345", 3)  =>  "135024"  ->  "304152"  ->  "012345"

    Together with the encryption function, you should also implement 
    A decryption function which reverses the process.

    If the string S is an empty value or the integer N is not positive, 
    return the first argument without changes.

    Note: 

    When I did submit my solution to this problem this message appears to me.
    
    Our servers are configured to only allow a certain amount of time for your code to execute. 
    In rare cases the server may be taking on too much work and simply wasn't able to run your code efficiently enough. 
    Most of the time though this issue is caused by inefficient algorithms. 
    If you see this error multiple times you should try to optimize your code further.

    This means my algorithms are not efficient ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜”
    But I will work on it to improve my algorithm performance ðŸ’ª.
