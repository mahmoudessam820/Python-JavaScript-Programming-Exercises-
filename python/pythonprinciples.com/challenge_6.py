    Double letters

    The goal of this challenge is to analyze a string to check if it 
    contains two of the same letter in a row. 
    For example, the string "hello" has l twice in a row, 
    while the string "nono" does not have two identical letters in a row.

    Define a function named double_letters that takes a single parameter 
    The parameter is a string. 
    Your function must return True if there are two identical letters 
    in a row in the string, and False otherwise.


    Hint

    Use a for or while loop and keep track of the current index. 
    In each iteration, grab the letter at the current index, 
    And the letter after that, and compare the two.

# My solution

def double_letters(letters):
    for letter in range(len(letters)-1):
        if letters[letter] == letters[letter+1]:
            return True
    return False

print(double_letters("letters"))


# Another soultion

def double_letters(string):
    for i in range(len(string) - 1):
        letter1 = string[i]
        letter2 = string[i+1]
        if letter1 == letter2:
            return True
    return False


# shorter solution
# using a list comprehension, zip, and any
def double_letters(string):
    return any([a == b for a, b in zip(string, string[1:])])


def has_double_letters(letters):

    for letter in range(len(letters)-1):
        if letters[letter] == letters[letter+1]:
            print(f"There were tow {letters[letter]} at postion {str(letter)}")

print(double_letters("nono"))
