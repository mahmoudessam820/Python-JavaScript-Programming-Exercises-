## Problems Solving Skills

### Introduction ⭐

Problems can be a nuisance, but they can also be an opportunity for growth.🚀

Problems can be a nuisance because they take up time and energy.🔥

When faced with a problem, it's important to have a plan.✨

Once you've identified a problem, come up with a plan to solve it. A problem and a plan are two separate things, and you can't solve a problem if you don't have a plan.
