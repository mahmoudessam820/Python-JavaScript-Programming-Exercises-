results = [] and 2 
print( False == (not results) )


# Output:

# a - True 
# b- False
# c- []
# d- 2


# Explanation:

# results = [] and 2: This line assigns the result of the logical and operation between an empty list [] and the integer 2 to the variable results. 
# In Python, the and operator returns the first operand if it evaluates to False, otherwise it returns the second operand. 
# Since the empty list [] evaluates to False, the result of this operation is [].
# print(False == (not results)): Here, we're comparing False with the negation of results.
# Since results is [], which evaluates to False, the negation of results becomes True.
# So, the comparison becomes False == True, which evaluates to False.

# the correct answer would be b. False.
