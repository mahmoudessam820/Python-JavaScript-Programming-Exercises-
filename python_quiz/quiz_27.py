# Python Quiz (27) ðŸ˜‰

# What is the output of this code and whyðŸ¤”?


print(not None != "")


# Output 

# a- None
# b- False
# c- True
# d- Error


# Explanation:

# First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the print statement: not None != ""
# In Python, the != operator has higher precedence than not, so we'll evaluate None != "" first
# None != "" is True, because None is not equal to an empty string
# So now we have: not True
# not True evaluates to False
# Therefore, print(not None != "") will output False

# The correct answer is: b- False ðŸ˜‰
